## Overview

**MiniMons** is a Pok√©mon-inspired game developed as the final project for our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Players embark on a journey to train their starter Pok√©mon and ultimately face the powerful Green Nightmare on the fourth map. Through exploration, battles, and leveling up, players prepare to take on this ultimate challenge.

## Project Description

MiniMons is a Pok√©mon-style game engine designed to offer classic monster-battling gameplay. Players can explore four unique maps, encounter wild Pok√©mon, level up their own, and test their strategies in battles. Maps are crafted with the [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) application and seamlessly integrated into our game using the [Tileson API](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/Tileson).

### Features
- **Multiple Maps**: Traverse four maps with various wild Pok√©mon encounters.
- **Battle System**: Engage in turn-based battles and level up your Pok√©mon.
- **Dynamic Environments**: Animations, fades, and transitions create an immersive experience.

## Main Data Structures

- **State Stack**: Manages states as a stack using `Stack`.
- **nlohmann JSON API**: Saves/loads game data.
- **Tileson API**: Parses JSON data from Tiled maps.
- **Resource Hashmaps**: Manages textures, sprites, etc., within `Resources`.
- **Tilemap Hashmaps**: Optimize tile lookups in `TilesMap`.
- **`std::array`**: Utilized for fixed-size structures.

## Design and Inspiration

Inspired by the CS50 game development course, MiniMons incorporates assets from various sources to create a visually engaging world. The Tileson API translates Tiled JSON data into in-game objects. The design is modular and extendable, making it easy to add new features.

Planned features (yet to be implemented):
- **NPC interaction** with OpenAI API.
- **Pok√©mon catching system**.
- **Object interaction** beyond tall grass.
- **Facilities** like Gyms, Shops, and Pok√©mon Centers.
- **Enhanced battle mechanics** with additional attacks and trainers.

## Known Bugs

- Character may move an extra space after battle.
- Resizing issues in menus when window size changes.
- Minor imperfections in fade-in and fade-out effects.
